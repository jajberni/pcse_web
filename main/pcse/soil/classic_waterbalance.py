    """Waterbalance for freely draining soils under water-limited production.

    The purpose of the soil water balance calculations is to estimate the
    daily value of the soil moisture content. The soil moisture content
    influences soil moisture uptake and crop transpiration.
    
    The dynamic calculations are carried out in two sections, one for the 
    calculation of rates of change per timestep (= 1 day) and one for the
    calculation of summation variables and state variables. The water balance
    is driven by rainfall, possibly buffered as surface storage, and
    evapotranspiration. The processes considered are infiltration, soil water
    retention, percolation (here conceived as downward water flow from rooted
    zone to second layer), and the loss of water beyond the maximum root zone. 

    The textural profile of the soil is conceived as homogeneous. Initially the
    soil profile consists of two layers, the actually rooted  soil and the soil
    immediately below the rooted zone until the maximum rooting depth (soil and
    crop dependent). The extension of the root zone from initial rooting depth
    to maximum rooting depth is described in Root_Dynamics class. From the
    moment that the maximum rooting depth is reached the soil profile is
    described as a one layer system. The class WaterbalanceFD is derived
    from WATFD.FOR in WOFOST7.1
