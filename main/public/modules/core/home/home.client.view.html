                        <p class="text-center">The main goal of this page is to provide a Virtual Laboratory for testing crop simulation models
                          and providing the test-bed for future implementation of decision support systems (DSS) for
                          scientists and farmers.</p>

                        <p class="text-center">Currently we inthe process of integrating Python Crop Simulation
                          Environment - PCE, which is a Python package for building crop simulation models and
                          in particular the crop models developed in Wageningen (Netherlands).</p>
